# COMP1010 - S1, 2025 - Assessment 1

## Project Title:
Optimizing Peer-to-Peer Data Distribution and Fault Tolerance in Torrent Networks


## Overview:
This project investigates methods for enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and fault tolerance of peer-to-peer (P2P) data distribution, with a particular focus on torrent networks. The research includes a detailed analysis of existing algorithms, identification of critical performance factors, and exploration of potential improvements through advanced data handling and redundancy techniques.

## Deliverables:
- **LaTeX Poster:** A professionally designed academic poster created using LaTeX, summarizing key findings and insights from the research.

## Instructions:
- Use LaTeX to design and compile your poster.
- Include clearly defined sections such as Abstract, Introduction, Technical Analysis, Results (with visualizations and graphs), Discussion (including ethical considerations), and Conclusion.
- Your poster should be visually appealing and concise, designed to clearly communicate complex ideas to a target audience of Year 11-12 high-school students.

## Technical Details (Recommended to Include):
- Graphical representations of peer-to-peer data flows
- Performance comparison graphs
- Visual diagrams showing redundancy and fault tolerance mechanisms
